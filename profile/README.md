## What is WALL-O?

WALL-O is a small robot able to track lines and avoid obstacles. The robot can be controlled via a [web application](https://wall-o.benjaminpmd.fr/). In order to use the robot, a server is needed, it will act as a bridge between the robot connection and the web application. The connection between the robot and the server uses a Bluetooth connection.
